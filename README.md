# WINE TOURISM

Wine tourism or enotourism was a blooming industry in 2018 and its popularity is still rising. Wine tourism includes the tasting, consumption or purchasing of wine  at or near the source. It can consist of visits to wineries, vineyards and restaurants known to offer unique experiences, as well as organized wine tours, wine festivals or other special events.
This single page site is designed to show statistics about the wine production by country and continent in 2018 and more important, to present an interactive map with 30 of the most beatiful vineyards and wineries to visit from 3 countries: Italy, France and Spain.

The deployed site can be found here: <https://vladoprea.github.io/wine-tourism/>

## User Experience

This is a single page site, easy to navigate. It begins with an bohemian introduction into the wine world and continues with a short brief of the site content structure. Even tough its main purpose is a turistic one, I included some statistics for a better understanding of this world phenomenon that helps the user to have a larger view about the subject.

### Structure and design objectives

+ First section contains a short description of wine to make the user enter its complex and beatiful world. It also contains text about the structure of the page.
+ Second section contains graphs with data about the wine production per country and per continent in 2018 and the vineyard surfaces used by those countries. They make the user more aware about the magnitude of this industry.
+ Third section contains a definition of wine tourism and three buttons that represent the top producers in the world as shown in the graphs.
+ The last section contains a map that shows 30 of the most recommended vineyards and wineries to visit. It allows the user to do a virtually first tour.
+ Background images are represented by grapes and vineyards to connect the text with a visual representation.
+ As a font, I used Merienda, which have an artistic touch on the page

### Target audience
